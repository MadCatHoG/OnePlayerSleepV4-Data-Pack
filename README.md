# One Player Sleep Data Pack for Minecraft 1.16 ++

Thank you for choosing my data pack! To better serve the community I've  added some fool-proofing needed for servers with odd settings like having the weather cycle off. Many years of testing in several servers and addressing all the problems has made this a really solid pack.

## Features

This One Player Sleep Data Pack allows a player to skip the night on a Multiplayer Server.

Some of the features include:

- Plug and Play. Drop the zip file in the datapacks folder of your world everything will be installed automatically
- Weather Control. A common problem in multiplayer servers is that the weather goes crazy after skipping the night too many times, this Data Pack solves it.
- Waking up system. Any player can wake up sleeping players to stop them from skiping the night, just click on the sleeping announcement.
- Random sleeping announcements. A series of messages displayed at random when someone sleeps.
- Random wake up messages. A series of messages when a player is woken up by somebody.
- Players can stop storms if they go to sleep when is daytime.
